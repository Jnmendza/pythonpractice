# Pros and Cons of LinkedLists
# Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements contiguously
#  - Pro: Easier to insert into and delete from the middle of a linked list compared
#        to an array (Why is this the case?)

#  - Con: Linked lists are not as cache-friendly since caches are typically optimized for
#        contiguous memory accesses.

# Linked lists do not need to be allocated with a static amount of memory up-front.
#  - Pro: We can keep adding elements to linked lists as much as we want, unlike arrays with
#        a static amount of allocated memory.
